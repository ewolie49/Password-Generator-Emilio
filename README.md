# Password-Generator-Emilio
In this task we were asked to create a random password generator.
We were provided with the HTML and CSS code as well as the basic functions that we needed to use in order to make it work
This is a good exercise to put in practice some of the JS learnt during week five of the course and also to continue doing research on the internet.

I have tried to be as descriptive as possible in all the messages provided to the user to ensure a good experience.

## Usage

Once you choose "Generate password" a message asking you for the length of the password is displayed.

If you introduce a number smaller than 8 or bigger than 128, you will receive a message asking to introduce the correct number.
I have been unable to validate only numbers, so if user introduces letters for example, the code would still run.

There has been quite a lot of research done for this project as well as working collaborativelly with other students during class hours.
